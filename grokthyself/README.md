# Simple MCP for your own context

- Login with X to get personal MCP link for free
- Upon one-time purchase ($129) it will index all of your history for private use with continuous updates
- In settings, switch between public/private

Context I want for myself:

- All my posts and comments and the entire thread of these surrounding my comments/posts
- Insights on the people I interacted with most (we have this data, it's just a query)

How:
