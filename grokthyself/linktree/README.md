background:

- linktree is valued at 1.3B in 2022 targeting the market of social commerce
- 50m users in 2024 https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/22/linktree-surpasses-50m-users-rolls-out-beta-social-commerce-program/
- https://competitive-analysis-demo.parallel.ai/analysis/linktr.ee
- https://linktr.ee/demilovato

learnings background:

- most people using it are influencers and brands, and they use it as a way to help others find them + create revenue for their online presence
- the creating revenue part is simply having a few links. although linktree has an offering to make revenue for their users, this product decision is likely driven by investors wanting more revenue, notasmuch because users wanted their revneue to come from linktree things (they could simply use other products and link there just as easily)

linktree onboarding flow (see screenshots):

1. every FREE linktree has a button to make your own linktree
2. choose what type of customer you are: creator, business or personal
3. sell 'pro' plan, try free for 7 days, with VERY small 'skip' button
4. if not, show pricing page with 'free' plan cleverly hidden below
5. when 'free' was clicked, select a template.
6. select which platforms you're on
7. get the links for these platforms from the user + additional links
8. add profile details
9. add suggested links
10. see how your linktree looks (looking good!)
11. learn more about what linktree offers in dashboard helper, then click 'finish setup' to ensure the user gets and shares the link in their bios.

learnings onboarding:

- make it hard to get it free, make free seem small, a linktree is worth a lot for businesses/creators
- their users care about how it LOOKS more than its functionality; selecting theme comes first, gives trust and inclincation to finish setup
- after a few platforms of the person were filled in, a search reveals other suggested links
- see how it looks before going to dashboard, in dashboard, a 'finish setup' guide is available, making it highly certain link gets shared.

How does clonechat fit in this market?

- Audience: target tech entrepreneurs
- Clonechat could become a plugin of link builders too, adding the personal context aspect, giving a chat
- We could very well focus on X as the central platform and focus on builders very active on X with exception of personal independent data, such as personal blog, rather than people who are active on several platforms. this aids the goal of migrating away from X giving X a reason to fear us, as well as to love us if we partner with them since we are so focused on deep understanding of X data.
- Our main growth channel is people actually sharing the link in different places and getting more people in there from that.

Takeaways:

- I am not sure if a chat that needs to be installed first fits this picture as there's more friction for end-users. It's hard to create a direct chat, and even with a direct chat, its unclear if that is what users will actually use from a bio link. Maybe there needs to be more. Therefore, maybe its better to not immediately try to "be a LinkTree". Although, its great though to have it
- To make it more interesting for parallel, it should find other socials of the person immediately, and find a deeper context of the person asap using a task.
